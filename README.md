We created an imptact and concussion detection helmet using a Freescale sensor board, and 
utilizing the accelerometer, gyroscope and altimeter to measure the impact in 3D Space.

We trained it to pick up sudden stops in acceleration as impact, with a very high threshold
which could only have been an impact and not a natural deceleration. This included straight trajectories,
whiplash (so rotation of the head around the neck, and a combination of both.
